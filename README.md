# Bitfield
A Python bitfield class for easier bit manipulation of integers


## TODO:
* Test more extensively with negative numbers
* Add classes/functions for working with `bytes` and `bytearray`s
* Construct a Bitfield from an iterable.
    - Can it be constructed lazily? Or should the focus be less on streams as on manipulations?
* Add Bit manipulation functions from `crypto` library.
* Add documentation and description to the README
